We plan to also model the effects of compression on these information QoI attributes.  While it is known in computer memories that compression will open up more capacity, the impact of compression combined with the added QoI from more (also possibly compressed) information can be characterized.  In human memories, while compression is not a capability in the same way it is in computers, the same effect may arise from humans processing data, extracting only key information.  We aim to provide a model of how this occurs and what the resulting QoI is. 

Finally, we will incorporate these models of information into networks, designing protocols for caching, routing, and admission control to provide the maximum QoI.  Understanding how QoI is impacted by time and load will allow us to study social networks and ``human in the loop" scenarios in which information is stored and exchanged through multi-genre networks.
