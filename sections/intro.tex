We seek to understand how information travels through human social networks and how that information leads to conclusions and decision-making.  In order to achieve this understanding, we must identify how the human memory stores and recalls information.  Specifically, we pull from cognitive psychology studies on the human memory to model nodes' abilities to recall and forward information factoids.
